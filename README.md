## How we write docs today
 
In every docs you see around the web in every page there is a bunch of links/text around a boring or sometimes kinda fancy code snippet thingy. But that can get annoying pretty quickly as you have to scroll back and forth between the code snippet and the actual text referring that code.

Tbh tho for beginners its always kinda boring or intimidating to read ALL this text from which they don't understand half of the stuff. 

## What we can be doing

What if while reading those code snippets you could just hover on the relevant *pieces of code*, read about it or whatever the author actually wants you to read.

Here is a working demo ðŸ‘‡
